# Flashblocks

Flashblocks enable OP Stack to produce logical sub-blocks of transactions at a much higher frequency (every 250ms) compared to the standard 2-second block time. This gives users the impression of near-instant inclusion and execution.

They work by offering pre-confirmations, which are early signals that a transaction will likely be included well before final block production. Since we operate in a Layer 2 environment where consensus finality isn't a hard requirement, we can offer these fast, highly reliable confirmations.

Flashblocks divide each 2-second block into 8 sub-blocks, allowing transactions to be processed and pre-confirmed at 250ms intervals.

Think of Flashblocks like sending a message one sentence at a time in a chat, rather than waiting to send the full message all at once. The recipient can begin reading (processing transactions) immediately, without waiting for the entire block.

## Developer usage

Developers can access Flashblocks data using the same Ethereum JSON-RPC calls they already know. The key is using the `pending` tag, which tells the RPC provider to look at the pre-confirmed state instead of the last finalized block.

For example, calling `eth_getBlockByNumber("pending")` will return a block that includes all the transactions processed in the latest Flashblock, even though the final block hasn't been created yet.

### Supported methods and behavior with `pending`:

*   **`eth_getTransactionReceipt`**: returns a receipt for pre-confirmed transactions from the cache. Some fields are placeholders at pre-confirmation time.
*   **`eth_getBlockByNumber`**: use `"pending"` to retrieve the latest Flashblock view. Responses are append-only within the block window and include cumulative fields like `stateRoot` and `receiptsRoot`.
*   **`eth_getBalance`**, **`eth_getTransactionCount`**: return values from `AccountMetadata` if present.
*   **`eth_getCode`**: returns contract bytecode from the cache if created in the Flashblock stream.
*   **`eth_getStorageAt`**: returns values from `storage_slots` in the cache.
*   **`eth_call`**: executes the call on top of the pre-confirmation overlay.
