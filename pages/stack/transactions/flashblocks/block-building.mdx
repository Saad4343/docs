# Block building

Flashblocks divide an L2 block window into smaller intervals and publish cumulative state as each interval completes. This preserves OP Stack protocol rules while giving faster pre-confirmations.

## How Flashblocks Work in OP Stack

OP Stack normally produces a block every 1 to 2 seconds. Flashblocks break that time window into smaller chunks. For example, eight 250ms pieces inside a 2-second block.

Instead of waiting the full block time to see all transactions, the system continuously builds and shares smaller "preview" blocks every few hundred milliseconds. Each preview contains all transactions processed so far, plus updated account balances and contract states.

The rollup-boost acts as the coordinator, managing communication between the regular block builder (`op-geth`) and the new Flashblocks builder (`op-rbuilder`). If the Flashblocks builder has problems, the system automatically falls back to the regular builder, making sure any pre-confirmations already given to users are still honored.

## Timing and ordering

The default target interval is 200 ms, though some deployments use 250 ms. A 2 second block at 200 ms produces 10 Flashblocks. Ordering is append-only within the block window: once a Flashblock is emitted, later Flashblocks cannot reorder its contents.

## Pre-confirmations

Pre-confirmations give early signals that a transaction will likely be included before the final block is created, allowing much faster user feedback. Detailed behavior and edge cases are explained in the [FAQ](#pre-confirmations-and-reorgs).

## High gas usage

Capacity grows across the window as additional Flashblocks are built. Transactions with large gas requirements may land in later Flashblocks within the same block. Builders use heuristics to balance fast feedback, gas utilization, and execution time within each interval.

## Flashblocks FAQ

### Block Building and Timing

<details>
  <summary>How often are Flashblocks produced?</summary>
  Default target interval is 200 ms, though some deployments use 250 ms. A 2 second block at 200 ms produces 10 Flashblocks.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Will the number of Flashblocks per block always be the maximum?</summary>
  Not necessarily. Heavy execution in one interval can reduce time available for subsequent intervals, and `FLASHBLOCKS_TIME` is a target rather than a strict rule.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do large gas transactions get delayed?</summary>
  Gas capacity increases across the window. Transactions requiring more gas than early intervals allow may land in a later Flashblock.
</details>

### High Availability and Safety

<details>
  <summary>What happens if the Flashblocks builder fails during a block window?</summary>
  The coordinator falls back to the regular block builder. Already issued pre-confirmations are preserved for that block, and the next block proceeds on the fallback path.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is continuity handled in high availability setups with multiple sequencers?</summary>
  Only the current leader streams Flashblocks. On leader change, streaming continues from the new leader so downstream consumers see a continuous stream from a single stable endpoint.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can more than one sequencer stream Flashblocks at the same time?</summary>
  No. The system ensures only one leader streams, which avoids conflicts and double streams.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do Flashblocks change the safety model of the chain?</summary>
  No. Each Flashblock is validated against the same execution engine that validates a normal block, so safety is equivalent to standard L2 blocks.
</details>

### Pre-confirmations and Reorgs

<details>
  <summary>Are pre-confirmations ever revoked once shown to users?</summary>
  Pre-confirmations are early signals that a transaction will likely be included before the final block is created. They can be reversed if the sequencer reorgs. The system prioritizes preserving previously issued pre-confirmations, but final inclusion is decided by the final L2 block.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why can a pre-confirmed transaction later disappear?</summary>
  If the sequencer reorgs, pre-confirmed state can be replaced. This does not add risk beyond the pending state reorg risk that already exists.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Does Flashblocks change liveness or withdrawals?</summary>
  No. Liveness guarantees and withdrawal behavior remain the same as standard OP Stack. Flashblocks improve feedback speed but do not change protocol guarantees.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What happens to the pre-confirmation view if there is a failover mid-window?</summary>
  Downstream providers continue from the leader stream. The pre-confirmation overlay is ephemeral and exists only until the final block is built, so providers reconcile to the final block once it is produced.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What fields can be placeholders at pre-confirmation time?</summary>
  In receipts and blocks served from the pre-confirmation view, fields like `blockHash` can be a placeholder and `blockNumber` can reflect the pending block. The view reflects the cumulative state of the latest Flashblock.
