# Upgrade 16a: Protocol upgrade

This page outlines important changes related to Upgrade 16a for chain operators and users. Upgrade 16a is a **maintenance upgrade that replaces Upgrade 16**, temporarily removing interop withdrawal-proving code while introducing system-level feature toggles. These changes are designed to improve safety, partner confidence, and flexibility in future upgrades.

<Callout type="info">
  The Upgrade 16a protocol upgrade on the **Sepolia** Superchain will be executed on **Tue, Sept 16, 2025**, and the **Mainnet** Superchain will be activated on **Thu, Sept 25, 2025 at [INSERT_TIME] PM UTC**.  
  The upgrade will be executed on the following chains: `OP`, `Soneium`, `Ink`, and `Unichain`.  
  Execution times may vary depending on the current state of each chain.
</Callout>

## What's included in Upgrade 16a

Upgrade 16a contains these main changes:

* **Interop withdrawal-proving code removed**  
  Interop-specific withdrawal code introduced in U16 has been removed in response to partner feedback. ETHLockbox remains supported for chains already on U16. Chains skipping directly from U15 → U16a will not adopt ETHLockbox until a future upgrade.

* **System-level feature toggles introduced**  
  Implemented via the `SystemConfig` contract. ETHLockbox is the first feature behind a system toggle. This enables customizable features (e.g. Custom Gas Token support) and more iterative rollouts.

* **Development feature flags**  
  Added to support deploying and testing interop functionality in non-production environments. These flags cannot be set on production chains.

* **OP Contracts Manager (OPCM) updates**  
  Supports both upgrade paths: `U15 → U16a` and `U16 → U16a`. 

## Impact summary

* No expected downtime.  
* No invalidation of existing withdrawal proofs for chains already on U16.  
* Chains still on U15 are subject to the same impact summary as U16.  
* Chains skipping directly from U15 → U16a will defer ETHLockbox adoption until a future upgrade.  
* Operators benefit from new system-level feature toggling, improving rollout of subsequent upgrades.
