# Upgrade 16a: Protocol upgrade

Upgrade 16a is a **maintenance release that supersedes Upgrade 16**. It temporarily removes unused interop withdrawal-proving code introduced in Upgrade 16 and adds system-level feature toggles to improve flexibility and rollout safety. These changes reduce risk while maintaining momentum toward the Superchain roadmap.

<Callout type="info">
  The Upgrade 16a protocol upgrade on the **Sepolia** Superchain will be executed on **Tue, Sept 16, 2025**, and the **Mainnet** Superchain will be activated on **Thu, Sept 25, 2025 at \[INSERT\_TIME] PM UTC**.\
  The upgrade will be executed on the following chains: `OP`, `Soneium`, `Ink`, and `Unichain`.\
  Execution times may vary depending on the current state of each chain.
</Callout>

## What's included in Upgrade 16a

Upgrade 16a introduces the following changes:

*   **Removal of interop withdrawal-proving code**\
    Code paths for interop withdrawals added in Upgrade 16 have been removed following partner feedback. ETHLockbox remains supported on chains already running U16. Chains moving directly from U15 → U16a will not adopt ETHLockbox until a future upgrade.

*   **System-level feature toggles**\
    Added via the `SystemConfig` contract. ETHLockbox is the first feature placed behind a toggle. This mechanism enables chain-specific configuration and safer iterative upgrades.

*   **Development-only feature flags**\
    Introduced to allow testing of interop functionality on non-production environments. These flags cannot be enabled on production chains.

*   **OP Contracts Manager (OPCM) updates**\
    Updated to support both upgrade paths: `U15 → U16a` and `U16 → U16a`.

## Impact summary

*   No downtime is expected.
*   Withdrawal proofs created under U16 remain valid.
*   Chains still on U15 are affected in the same way described in the Upgrade 16 notice.
*   Chains upgrading directly from U15 → U16a will not adopt ETHLockbox until a future release.
*   System-level toggles improve operator control and make future upgrades easier to roll out.

## For chain operators

If you're upgrading from Upgrade 15, follow the [chain operator instructions for U16](https://docs.optimism.io/notices/upgrade-16#for-chain-operators). 

Note that upgrading from Upgrade 15 involves a one-time invalidation of all existing withdrawal proofs. Users who have proven withdrawals can either finalize withdrawals prior to the activation of Upgrade 16a or will be required to re-prove these withdrawals after the upgrade activates.
