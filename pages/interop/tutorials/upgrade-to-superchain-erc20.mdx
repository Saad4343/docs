# Upgrading ERC20 to SuperchainERC20

## Overview

This guide explains how to upgrade an ERC20 to a [`SuperchainERC20`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainERC20.sol) that can teleport across the [Superchain interop cluster](/interop/explainer#superchain-interop-cluster) using the [`SuperchainTokenBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainTokenBridge.sol) contract. For more information on how it works, [see the explainer](/interop/superchain-erc20).

<Callout type="warning">
  The code on the documentation site is sample code, *not* production code.
  This means that we ran it, and it works as advertised.
  However, it did not pass through the rigorous audit process that most Optimism code undergoes.
  You're welcome to use it, but if you need it for production purposes you should get it audited first.
</Callout>

{/* 

I put this warning here, when we don't have it on most pages, because this tutorial
has, IMHO, code that is a lot more likely to be used in production. It doesn't just
show what is possible, it does the exact job needed.

*/}

There are several ways to upgrade an existing ERC20 for interop, depending on the exact circumstances.

*   Can you just install a new ERC20 contract? If so, [deploy new `SuperchainERC20` contracts](/interop/tutorials/deploy-superchain-erc20).
*   Are you unable to upgrade the existing ERC20 contract? If so, [use the lockbox solution](/interop/tutorials/upgrade-to-superchain-erc20/lockbox).
*   Can you deploy contracts on the other chains in the same address as the proxy used in the original chain? If so, [do a contract upgrade](/interop/tutorials/upgrade-to-superchain-erc20/contract-upgrade).

{/* 

*   If you can upgrade the existing contract, but the address is not available on other chains? In that case, use a custom bridge 

upgrade-to-superchain-erc20/custom-bridge.
